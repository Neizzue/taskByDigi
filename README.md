# taskByDigi

There are 3 folders that contains 3 different task given by Digi-X team for the internship application.
Only 2 of the task were successfully solved and hosted, which are the calculator and the lightbulb effect tasks.
The upload-unzip-display task are not able to be solved in one week given time. However I code a method to upload, unzip and display using Python language but unable to communicate with HTML to display the Python outputs on HTML. Best possible ways would be by using PHP.
